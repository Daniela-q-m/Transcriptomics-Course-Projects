#Load the file GSE124548.raw.txt and create a new dataframe with just the columns with the raw counts for healthy (HC) and CF patients before treatment (Base) and call it readcount. Use the third column (EntrezID) in the original file as the rownames of readcount.

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
#Load the Deseq2 package ( install if necessary ) and create a Counts Dataset Matrix using the command DESeqDataSetFromMatrix() and call it cds.
cds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = readcount,
                              colData = expgroup,
                              design= ~ condition)

```{r}

```
```{r}
#Use the functions estimateSizeFactors and estimateDispersions so that Deseq2 can correct for size of library and estimates the dispersion. Plot the dispersion using plotDispEsts. What does the graph tell you?

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
plotDispEsts(cds)
```
```{r}
#Dispersion tells information about the variability in the data. With DESeq2 the dispersion is higher for small mean counts and lower for large mean counts. The idea behind fitting a curve to the data is that different genes will have different scales of biological variability, but, over all genes, there will be a distribution of reasonable estimates of dispersion.This curve is displayed as a red line in the figure below, which plots the estimate for the expected dispersion value for genes of a given expression strength. Shrinking the values toward the curve could result in false positives, so these values are not shrunken. These genes are shown surrounded by blue circles below.
#You expect your data to generally scatter around the curve, with the dispersion decreasing with increasing mean expression levels.
```

### Plot PCA 
#Here we can see that cystic fibrosis and healthy samples tend to cluster together and PCA shows separation between the two groups. 
plotPCA(rld, intgroup="condition")
```
```{r}
rld_matrix <- assay(rld)  #we may not need this

```
```{r}

```
 #Together, these plots suggest to us that the data are of good quality
```{r}
#Perform the Differential expression and obtain the results using DESeq and results functions.
#Null hypothesis is that there is no differential expression across the two sample groups (LFC == 0).
# If the p-value is small we reject the null hypothesis and state that there is evidence against the null (i.e. the gene is differentially expressed).
#To build our results table we will use the results() function.
