#Dispersion tells information about the variability in the data. With DESeq2 the dispersion is higher for small mean counts and lower for large mean counts. The idea behind fitting a curve to the data is that different genes will have different scales of biological variability, but, over all genes, there will be a distribution of reasonable estimates of dispersion.This curve is displayed as a red line in the figure below, which plots the estimate for the expected dispersion value for genes of a given expression strength. Shrinking the values toward the curve could result in false positives, so these values are not shrunken. These genes are shown surrounded by blue circles below.
#You expect your data to generally scatter around the curve, with the dispersion decreasing with increasing mean expression levels.

#What conclusions can you make about your analysis?
##This analysis shows that there are differentially expressed genes in those with and without Cystic Fibrosis. Genes associated with the immune response had significantly increased expression. Genes associated with different types of immune cell activation were prevalent in GO category for biological process. The genes in the GO category for cellular ocmpartment were mainly involved in cell-to cell interactions as well as vesicle formation. These were particularly interesting since cystic fibrosis involves the overproduction of mucus so it makes sense that genes associated with secretion are upregulated. Genes associated with molecular function saw upregulation in genes involved in signal transduction. The next step in this analysis is to analyze how a drug treatment affects the gene expression in those with cystic fibrosis. The largest portion of significantly enriched genes with p value under 0.001 was in the biological process category.
